    <h3>Profile Summary</h3>
    <h4>Hello There!</h4>
    <p class="about">
        My name is
        <b>Chelsea Bahsler</b>
        and I am a Business to Information Technologies (a.k.a BIT)
        student at Red River College.
    </p>
    <p class="about">
        In school, I find my programming courses to be the most enjoyable.
        I love the feeling that comes with solving problems using coding 
        logic and I like the creative aspect that comes with the programming process.
    </p>
    <p class="about">
        In terms of career paths related to programming, I'm still trying to decide if I want to become a software developer, a videogame developer,
        or take on a job that's related to information security.
    </p>
    <p class="about">
        When I'm not dealing with programming projects or a dealing with a copious amount of homework,
        I'm usually experimenting with different art techniques.
        Listed in the portfolio section, I've included a small section dedicated to some of the art pieces that I'm most proud of
        as well as a list of up-and-coming projects that I plan to tackle during the month of May 2021.
    </p>
    <p class="about">
        At the time that I am making this website, my second term in College is coming to an end.
        Despite the limitations due to Covid-19, I've learned a lot in the past few months.
        In the terms to come, I hope to continute my learning and decide a career path that I know will make me happy in the long run.

        Let's just hope that things work out in the end.
